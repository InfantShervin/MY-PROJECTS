A Sentiment Analyzer is a machine learning or NLP-based tool that evaluates emotions, opinions, or attitudes from text, speech, or other input data. It classifies sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, making it useful for applications like customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and chatbot interactions.
